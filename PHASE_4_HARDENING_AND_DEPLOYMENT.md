PHASE_4_HARDENING_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md
Task 4.1: Comprehensive End-to-End Testing
Objective: Ensure the entire system, especially the autonomous runner, is stable enough for long-term, unattended operation.
Implementation Steps:
"Chaos Monkey" Testing:
Network Failure: Run autonomous_runner.py and disconnect the internet. Verify that it logs LLMConnectionError or GmailAPIError and continues its loop without crashing.
Invalid Credentials: Delete config/token.json while the runner is active. The next job should fail with an AuthenticationError, log the critical issue, and wait for a long interval before retrying.
LLM Service Down: Stop the LM Studio server. The realtime_processing job should be skipped due to failing its prerequisite check.
Long-Duration Soak Test:
Set up the systemd services using the provided setup.sh script.
Let the autonomous_runner.py run for at least 24-48 hours.
Monitor logs/automation.log and data/automation_state.json. Check for memory leaks (using a tool like psutil in a monitoring script), ensure jobs are triggering at the correct times according to their cron schedules, and verify that the last_run and status fields in the state file are being updated correctly.
Task 4.2: Final Documentation Polish
Objective: Create clear, comprehensive documentation for both end-users and future developers.
Implementation Steps:
Update README.md: Create a user-friendly guide covering:
Quick Start: How to get the GUI running with start.sh.
Configuration: A clear explanation of config/settings.json and the .env file.
Autonomous Setup: Detailed instructions on how to use setup.sh and systemd to run the bot as a background service.
Feature Overview: A non-technical explanation of what each feature (Bulk Processing, Auto-Analyze, Unsubscribe) does.
Developer Guide (DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md): Create a new document that explains the project's internal architecture, the purpose of each major script, the data flow for different modes of operation, and how to add new features or bug fixes, referencing the provided Gmail Bot Development Guide.docx where appropriate.
